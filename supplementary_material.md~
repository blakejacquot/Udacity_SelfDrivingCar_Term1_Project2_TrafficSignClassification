### Reviewer feedback

It is great that you tried to play around with different architectures, however, seems
like you forgot to mention what are those architecture you played with.

Question Requirement

According to the rubric, student should thoroughly discusses the approach taken for
deriving and designing a model architecture fit for solving the problem given. You only
stated you played with different architecture, however, you still need to illustrate how
did you design those architecture and run the experiment. You could follow the checklist
below to make the model architecture design discussion.

Here is a checklist for this question:
Please discuss how did you choose the optimzer. (Missed Answer)
Please discuss how did you decide the number of type of layers. (Missed Answer)
Please discuss how did you tune the hyperparameter. (Missed Answer)
Please discuss how did you train your model. (Missed Answer)
Please discuss how would you evaluate the model. (Missed Answer)

You did a very nice job to predict the captured image, however, it only partially covered
 the question requirement. Let me explain it a bit below.

Question Requirement

According to the rubric and the question, student should compare the result of the
captured images with the validation set. We are expecting you to export some statistical
results to proof the accuracy of your model and it would be a metric to help us to measure
the prediction difference between the validation and real world testing.

Please compare the prediction accuracy of the result of the captured images with the
validation set.
